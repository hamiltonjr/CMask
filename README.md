#CMask

                A simple mask calculation for a UNIX-like SO.

This is the code of cmask.c that calculates the user mask for UNIX-like Operation Systems (Linux). It's written in ANSI C and follows
the instruction that I receiced about this funcionality as it needed.

Sure it's simple for a project, but I intend to include new features on it.
